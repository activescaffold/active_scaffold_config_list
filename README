This works with Rails 2.3 and the rails-2.3 branch of ActiveScaffold.

Usage:
Enabled by default. To disable add the following to your controller:
active_scaffold :model do |config|
  config.config_list.enabled = false
end

Enhancements:
Two new options have been added: "Reset to Default" and "Show All Columns"

You have the option of defining a default set of columns for the controller.
e.g
config.config_list.default_columns = [:name, :project, :amount]
If this is not defined then active_scaffold_config.list.columns is used.

This is useful when you want the option to look at a potentially large number of columns but be able to 
easily reset back to something that fits on the screen without horizontal scrolling.
